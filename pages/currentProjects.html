					<h2>
						~1994 Specialized Epic Comp
					</h2>

					<img src="../css/images/epic.jpg" width=100%>

					<p>
						The Specialized Epic Comp is a lugged carbon frame. There is a surprisingly small amount of information about this bike on the internet; I was only able to find a handful of catalogs and only in German. Therefore I have no idea what year this is from. In 1991 this frame was not in the catalog. In 1992 to 1994, the photos show integrated shifters while the frame has bosses for downtube shifters. This frame was actually recalled by Specialized becasue the tubes were poorly bonded to the lugs, risking spontaneous decontruction. Pragmatically speaking, there is no place for the frame in today's world. It's flexy compared to aluminium frames, heavy compared to monocoque carbon, and doesn't offer the multitude of benefits that come with steel. However there is the cool factor of riding a unique frame with a stunning paint job which makes it 100% worth it to me.

						Pictured above is the preliminary mockup of the build. To be completely honest, the final will have very different parts. I plan to use a shorter stem which will be more comfortable. The rear triangle doesn't acommodate 25c tires (in the picture the tire has no pressure) so I will put on a set of 23c tires. I plan to use Shimano Claris derailleurs and microshift 2x8 shifters. I got a really nice deal for a pair of older Shimano 105 brakes in very good condition so I'm excited to finally use them. I will be using the same wheels and cassette pictured; Shimano RS10 and Shimano HG-50 11-32. I was in a crash that put the rear wheel out of true but a few minutes in the stand should have it good to go. The headset is has cheap caged bearings instead of sealed bearings, but to me, it doesn't make much of a difference. The cherry on top will be the Silca Impero salvaged from my previous bike that fits like a glove.
