					<p><mark>Srei centers the stories of four young women: Ellie, Shanelle, Kaliyah, and Pei Yi. Through interviews over the course of two summers, the girls comment on the lives and struggles of women of color growing up in America–chosen family and sisterhood; the ways Asian women are forced to grow up too fast; migration; self love and acceptance; and healing from personal and generational trauma. They paint a picture of the beauty and strength of this community, as well as the constantly overlooked issues facing Asian women in Oakland, the Bay, and the US as a whole.</mark></p>
