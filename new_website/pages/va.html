				<p><mark>Dreaming of Home is an in-progress piece for Intermediate Video Art which was created in response to a prompt that asked us to consider the medium of home video or “the home mode.” The piece explores my relationship to memory, nostalgia, and place–intending to capture the unmoored feeling of loss that I experienced in college away from my home in the Bay.</mark></p>
				
				<p><mark>I often struggle with memory. Both recent and long past events can exist in my head like memories of a dream–immaterial and spotty. This is something I’ve attempted to remedy through excessive documentation of my life with videos and photos. To me, the “home mode” is crucial to constructing and maintaining memory. However, the home mode is limited by what we deem worthy of portrayal–moments with friends and family, significant events, etc. The subtle parts of my life–driving home at night, walking to work, loitering around Downtown–moments that constitute a sense of place are significantly absent from my collections of photos and videos.</mark></p>
				
				<p><mark>This project is an attempt to reconstruct memory and sense of place through projection, through music, through altering my space. Dreaming of Home is a love letter to the East Bay, forever the place I will call home.</mark></p>

			<h2>How to Look Asian</h2>
			<video controls="controls"><source src="../videos/how_to_look_asian/Okazaki_1_Appropriation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
			<div id="asian_less_text" class="less">
				<p><mark>How to Look Asian is a piece made for Intermediate Video Art consisting of “appropriated” internet found footage. The prompt for this project asked us to critically comment on media/dominant culture through juxtaposition. When thinking about elements of juxtaposition within culture, what came to mind was the popularization of East Asian features as desirable or trendy alongside a massive rise in racialized violence towards Asian Americans in 2020.</mark></p>

				<p><mark>How to Look Asian is a piece made for Intermediate Video Art consisting of “appropriated” internet found footage.

When thinking about elements of juxtaposition within culture, what came to mind was the popularization of East Asian features as desirable or trendy alongside a massive rise in racialized violence towards Asian Americans in 2020.</mark></p>
				
				<p><mark>Somewhat due to the greater visibility of Asian pop culture, elements of Asianness and Asian culture that were previously a source of ridicule have become desirable. Through face-taping, makeup techniques, or even surgery, non-Asian people replicate exotified or exaggerated takes on Asian features. In some cases, this is done in order to profit off of the ways in which Asian women are hypersexualized as both submissive and exotic. Through selective editing and the juxtaposition of a variety of appropriated clips from social media (YouTube), I intend to portray cultural appropriation as a form of violence and create dialogue on the meaning of Asianess in America.</mark></p>
		
				<p><mark>How to Look Asian asks what it means to be Asian, what it means to be Asian American–is it the presentation of your body, through being the owner of a set of features that are racially coded as Asian? Is it the experience of racialized violence and oppression? To me, to be Asian American is to hold a deep cultural understanding of historical trauma, perseverance, and joyous community. </mark></p>

			<h2>Self Portrait</h2>
			<video controls="controls"><source src="../videos/self_portrait/Daisy O proj 6_self portrait.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
			<p><mark>Self Portrait was a final project for an intro video art course. Through objects and old drawings, I reflect on my relationship with my body and how I constructed my sense of self at the height of the pandemic. At a time where my sense of identity was most fragile I turned to books, to art, to try and piece together who I was when I was not constantly being perceived. Self Portrait is a retrospective exploration of adolescent crisis, of growing into identity as a queer, mixed race kid.</mark></p>

			<p><mark>Line of Sight was created for an intro to video art piece which prompted us to consider constraights of the body. The piece explores relationships between the gaze, beauty, and constraints placed on queer bodies.</mark></p>
